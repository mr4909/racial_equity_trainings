# Racial Equity Trainings

## Examining Racial Disparities, Bias, and Profiling Using Criminal Justice System Administrative Data  

This training is designed to provide a framework for understanding the measurement and analysis of racial (in)equity within the criminology and criminal justice fields, with an emphasis on policy issues in policing, prosecution, courts, sentencing, supervision, and corrections.  More specifically, it will focus on racial equity in the administration of criminal justice and the decision points along the continuum where there is considerable discretion afforded to the various systems and actors.  It will bring participants up-to-speed on the most recent research on race equity and criminal justice, concentrating on the methods used to conduct these analyses.  It will also include hands-on training in STATA and R on how to conduct analyses of racial disparities, bias, and profiling.

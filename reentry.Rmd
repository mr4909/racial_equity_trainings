Client Generated Research Question: But before I build policy and practice, I need some facts regarding whatâ€™s going on. Do people of color experience a higher number re-entry challenges than whites, and does this impact their ability to remain out of prison?

**Data Details:** Includes short surveys of 1,020 individuals, recently released from state prison in Maricopa County, Arizona and tracked over a 2-year time period. There are three waves of data: wave 1 takes places about 1 month before the individual is released from prison, wave 2 takes place about 1-year post-release, and wave 3 takes place about 2 years post-release. Personal characteristics that are time-invariant assessed prior to release from prison. Time-varying characteristics are assessed at 1- and 2-years post-release from prison. Recidivism is defined as re-incarceration or returning to prison and verified using administrative data (i.e., ADOC confirms the respondent was re-incarcerated). While all individuals were surveyed regardless of whether or not they were incarcerated at either waves 2 or 3, some time-varying characteristics will be not applicable if the individual has been re-incarcerated.
